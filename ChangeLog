04-30-04  Revised  atompaw to use modern Fortran 90 structures and to
          allow for new scheme for constructing Vloc (see NewatompawNotes.tex,
          NewatompawNotes.pdf)

    To compile:
       makescript [compiler] atompaw
         where [compiler] references a make.[compiler] file that
         you can construct for your system.  Sample files are given
         for make.intel, make.absort, make.sun, etc.
    To run:
       input is now more amenable to interactive input.  Two examples
       are given below
--------------------C using old Vloc form-----------------------start---
C    6              Atomic symbol and #
'LDA-PW'            Exchange correlation type

--------------------C using new Vloc from norm-conserving form--end-----

-----------------Older history---------------------------------------
Modifications
              8-25-01 --  Changed the Broyden iteration scheme with an
                          Anderson Mixing module similar to that used in
                          pwpaw.

              8-25-01 --  Replaced the exchange-correlation module with one
                          that can either calculate the LDA (Perdew-Wang)
                          or GGA (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) as contolled by
                          the keywords 'LDA-PW' or 'GGA-PBE', respectively.
                          Currently, only those keywords work properly.
                          Other LDA or GGA forms could easily be added.
                          An an example new input file for C is given by:

-------------------C.input------------------------------------------
C                Atom summary file name
6 'GGA-PBE'      Z
2 2 0 0 0        maximum n for s, p, d, f, g shells
2 1 2            correction to maximum occupancy (n l occ)
0 0 0            end corrections
c                core state
v                valence state
v                valence state
vloc0            Specify non-zero vloc amplitude
9.7874329E+00    value of vloc amplitude
ipass            use default parameters
1                lmax
1.3              rc
n                no new l=0 bases functions

c                continue
2                new valence occupancy

e                exit
-----------------end-------------------------------------------------

              8-25-01 -- Version tested in ~/pgmwork/atompawwithatompaw

             11-05-01 -- Corrected Cp solver in bsolvtphi -- converges
                          for more cases

             12-12-01 -- Corrected infinite loop problem in fcsepatom
             12-13-01 -- Replaced density convergence test with
                            criterion based on onset of fluctuations
             01-08-02 -- corrected small error in fcsepatom.f90
             05-09-02 -- Made minor change to excorpbe.f90 in order
                           to make the gradient term more stable
                           following suggestion of Ryan Hatcher and
                           also added symmetrization of VHartree
                           terms following email discussion with
                           Francois Jollet
             08-03-02 -- Made minor change to frozencore pgm; simplified
                           output to report only total energies and
                           differences between total energies; fixed bug
                           to allow calculation of configurations with
                           zero valence electrons
             10-27-02 -- Changed TPHI output for LCAO functions to ensure
                           finite range. Each TPHI is modified within the
                           range 6 < r < 10 bohr according to
                                       ( sin(Pi*(r-rstart)/delta) )^2
                               TPHI(r)*(--------------------------)
                                       (  (Pi*(r-rstart)/delta)   )
                           where rstart=6, delta=rend-rstart, rend=10.
                           Note that the TPHI functions are not normalized.
             01-10-03 -- Changed ftprod.f90 to reflect TPHI truncation.  Also
                           introduced slight changes to make code compatible
                           with absoft compiler.
             07-09-03 -- Changes by Francois Jollet and Marc Torrent for
                           compatibility with Abinit code. Also made the
                           calculation of vlocfac automatic for setting it
                           for aligning the valence s orbital as the local
                           potential.  (If input sets |vlocfac| > 10^-7,
                           the set value is kept.) Additional programing
                           changes to gradually "modernize" the code were made,
                           but since this is a very daunting task, we quit
                           before breaking something.....
             08-05-03 -- Tested code with intel 7.1 compiler, using ATLAS
                           http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/ library for
                           blas.  Compilation with intel or absoft facilitated
                           with script:
                                makescript (intel or absoft) (atompaw or
                                     frozencore or clean)
                           Need to edit make.intel or make.absoft files
                           for proper library locations and compiler flags.


             07-13-04 -- "Modernized" program structure and introduced new options
                           for vloc based on norm-conserving pseudopotential
                           for l > lmax (largest l for projectors).
             10-20-04 -- minor improvement to GGA algorithm
             12-31-04 -- introduced core tail function to take into account
                           frozen core density which extends beyond rc
             01-03-05 -- implemented PAW-XML output according to the
                           fsatom-pp@tddft.org project
                         http://www.fysik.dtu.dk/campos/atomic_setup/paw_setup.html
             01-08-05 -- using Alan Tackett's xmlword.f90 and xmlstrings.f90
                           wrote xmlpaw.f90 to scan [atom].xml file and
                           create [atom].atomicdata.fromxml file which compares
                           very closely to original [atom].atomicdata file
             09-13-05 -- Found slight error in pseudo.f90 in character length
                           of PAW%Vloc_description (should be 256).  Also note
                           that some compilers differ enough to change the
                           the value of PAW%irc by +- 2, which seems not
                           to make a significant difference in the end results.
             12-20-05 -- Implemented option to construct basis and projector
                            functions based on David Vanderbilt's ultra-soft
                            pseudopotential paper  PRB 41, 7892 (1990)
                            Requires input of r_i < r_c for each basis function.
             01-17-06 -- Corrected XLM output for kinetic energy to be
                            Hartree Units  (Thanks to Marc Torrent)
             01-22-06 -- Added VLOCION output to atomicdata file -- form of
                            ionic local potential needed by abinit, not used by
                            pwpaw
             01-23-06 -- Added INITOCC output to atomicdata file -- used by
                            abinit, perhaps could be used by pwpaw; indicates
                            initial occupancies of valence basis functions
             04-21-06 -- Noticed that atomicdata file contains spurious
                            values of Hartree matrix elements; these have
                            now been removed.
             05-22-06 -- Revised pgm to accept either linear grid (default)
                            or logarithmic grid (need to add keyword to
                            second input line in quotes for example:
                             'PW-LDA    loggrid'  or
                             'PBE-GGA   loggrid')
                            Grid parameters are hard coded -- may need to be
                            adjusted.
             06-10-06 -- worked with Marc Torrent to validate Atompaw2abinit
                            interface and allowed for optional input of
                            number of grid points.   Thus the second line
                            of the code can read
                            PW-LDA    loggrid    1001
                            for example if 1001 loggrid points are desired.
                            For a linear grid, the input is as before and
                            the number of points is fixed.
             06-14-06 -- Corrected xml portion to be consistent with FSATOM
                            standard on website
                         http://dcwww.camp.dtu.dk/campos//pawxml/pawxml.xhtml
                         Note: consequent line lengths too long for absoft
                                compiler
                         Also note that in order to output input data to
                          xml file, pgm takes an input argument of the input
                          file name.   For example if the input file is
                          called Fe.input, the call would be
                          atompaw Fe.input<Fe.input>&output&
                          Note: the xml reading routines have not be updated.
             06-29-06 -- Implemented possibility of scalarrelativistic
                          treatment, following the second order form
                          the Dirac equation given by Shadwick, Talman,
                          and Normand, Comp. Phys. Comm. 54 95-102 (1989),
                          averaging over kappa for a given l.   In this case
                          the second input line would read
                          PW-LDA   loggrid   1001 scalarrelativistic
                          It is not advisable to use a linear grid for
                          the scalarrelativistic case. Also note that at the
                          moment, there is no adjustment to the exchange
                          functional for relativistic effects.
            07-05-06 -- Corrected several bugs thanks to Marc Torrent
            07-07-06 -- Several corrections from Jens jorgen Mortensen and
                          Marc Torrent; added capability to use Gaussian
                          shape for compensation charge as suggested by
                          Peter Bloechl (see comments at the beginning of
                          atompaw.f90).   Simplified keywords and options
                          according to preferred schemes, however, old
                          keywords still work.
           08-30-06 -- Added new code for additional options written by
                          Marc Torrent.
           09-04-06 -- With Xiao Xu's help, found error in scalarrelativistic
                          mode with GGA, although LDA gives reasonable results.
                          Because of the sensitivity of the GGA to gradients
                          of the density, the GGA option is currently
                          disabled for the scalarrelativistic mode.
           09-05-06 -- Introduced output for single-center self-energy
                          estimate to be used in pwpaw from [atom].scself
           09-18-06 -- Corrected BUG in GGA equations for vxc found by
                          Marc Torrent.   Also replaced scalar-relativistic
                          solver with program adapted by Marc Torrent and
                          Francois Jollet from USPS pgm of David Vanderbilt
                          based on two coupled first order differential
                          equations. Previous version, based on second order
                          differential equation from formalism of Shadwick,
                          Talman, and Norman, Comp. Phys. Comm. 54, 95-102
                          (1989)  found to be unstable. Even with the
                          new code, we find it necessary to use a low-order
                          derivative formula -- "simplederiv" to evaluate
                          the gradients for GGA in the scalarrelativistic mode.
           09-26-06 -- Introduced option for scalar-relativistic mode for
                          replacing point nucleus with a Gaussian.  Effectively
                          replacing the nuclear potential of 2*Z/r with
                          2*Z*erf(r/R)/r, where the size parameter R in
                          bohr units is given by 2.9*10^(-5)*Z^(1/3), as
                          given by a simple nuclear model in old texts. This
                          option is activated with "finite-nucleus" keyword.
                          For this to work, it is necessary to choose an
                          adequate number of grid points within the finite
                          nucleus.
           10-14-06 -- Improved stability of boundsch and boundsr following
                          problem identified by Ping Tang.   When solver
                          fails wavefunction is replaced by a suitable
                          hydrogen-like solution.  This does not always help.
                          For the case of Mn in the 3d7 4s0 configuration,
                          the calculation fails with a linear grid, but
                          works well with the logarithmic grid.
           11-30-06 -- Many new options introduced by Marc Torrent.
           12-13-06 -- NAWH corrected bug found by Marc Torrent which effects
                          charged ions.   Pgm should now work for charged ions.
           12-21-06 -- Marc Torrent & NAWH completed testing (of course there
                          always may be more bugs).   This version is
                          designated as version 2.0.
           02-16-07 -- Corrected problem for Vanderbilt-style projectors
                           with pseudowavefunction rcl<vloc_rc.  This
                           version designated as version 2.1.
           08-25-07 -- Marc Torrent introduced option control grid better and
                           to output pseudodensity for future work in abinit.
                           New options are:
                           Gridsize (specify total number of grid pts. with
                                 default maximum range)
                           Gridsize rmax (specify total number of grid pts with
                                 maximum range of rmax)
                           Gridsize rmax rmatch (specify number of grid pts
                                 between 0 and rmatch; continue grid to rmax)
           05-05-10 -- Minor corrections found by Marc Torrent concerning
                           initialization and allocation
                       Also introduce additional abinit-compatible vloc
                           which DOESNOT include nhat density in VXC which
                           is now output in [].atomicdata using
                           keyword VLOCION_NOHAT
           05-11-10 -- Additional changes by Marc Torrent to allow USEXCNHAT
                           option within abinit
           06-17-10 -- Yann Pouillon and Marc Torrent changed code to be
                           compabible with standard GNU.  Natalie Holzwarth
                           added pwscfinterface.f90 to output UPF file for
                           use with PWscf which is not working yet.
           08-02-10 -- NAWH added grid interpolation in order to make
                           pwscfinterface.f90 work properly with PWscf code.
                           Cubic splines from DeBoor's web site are used.
           09-20-10 -- MT  added routine for complex objects clean destruction
                           in order to avoid memory leaks
           09-20-10 -- MT  added new input keyword 'logderivrange'
                           (to be put on second line of input file)
                           This allows to change range and number of points
                           used to plot logarithmic derivatives
           09-20-10 -- MT  added abinitinterface.f90 file
                           Atompaw2Abinit tool is now integrated in AtomPaw
           10-07-10 -- MT  added printing of core WF for Abinit
           10-13-10 -- MT  added external LibXC support
                           (http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc)
           10-04-11 -- MT  added output of version number
           01-22-11 -- NAWH made small corrections suggested by J. Zwanziger 
                           and fixed linsol and minverse in globalmath.f90
                           for better compatibility with compilers as suggested
                           by Marc Torrent and Xavier Gonze.
